        <h2>Introduction to Node JS - Lesson Summary</h2>

            <h3>Bellow you will find key information covered in this module:</h3>
            <lo>
                <li>As an event-driven, asynchronous JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to create scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, several concurrent connections are supported. On each connection, the callback is triggered, but Node.js will sleep if there is no work to be performed.</li>
                <li>This is in contrast to the prevalent concurrency approach of today, which employs OS threads. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and cumbersome to employ. In addition, users of Node.js need not worry about deadlocking the process because there are no locks.</li>
                <li>Virtually no Node.js function does I/O directly, therefore the process never stalls until I/O is performed using synchronous methods of the Node.js standard library. Node.js makes the development of scalable systems relatively feasible since nothing blocks.</li>
                <li>Node.js is conceptually comparable to and influenced by Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js extends the event model somewhat. It exposes an event loop as a runtime structure as opposed to a library.</li>
                <li>In Node.js, HTTP is a first-class citizen, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node.js an ideal base for a web framework or library.</li>
                <li>Even though Node.js was developed without threads, you may still take use of numerous cores in your environment.</li>
